  <h3>Luke Nelson - Treasurer</h3>
  <p>
    | Hey, I’m Luke! I’m a senior studying ecological restoration, and I’ve been the treasurer
    | for OCVT since my sophomore year. I joined the club because I’ve been interested in the
    | outdoors since I was a little kid, and I was excited to meet other nature enthusiasts. Some
    | of my favorite outdoor activities are walking around and looking at plants, climbing trees,
    | and backpacking.
