    <h2>About OCVT</h2>
    <p>
      | Virginia Tech's location in the mountains of Southwestern Virginia makes an
      | ideal playground for all things outdoors. With the Appalachian Trail and
      | the Blue Ridge Parkway to the west and east respectively, the opportunities
      | for hiking, biking, boating, skiing, sailing, and wide range of other
      | activities are available. The Outdoor Club at Virginia Tech takes full
      | advantage of these opportunities.
    </p>

    <p>
      | While primarily students, the club is open to community members. In
      | addition, due the wide variety of interest within the club, there is
      | opportunity for novices in sports to learn new skills or improve existing
      | ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      | Beyond recreation, the clubs second main focus is the maintenance of a
      | 30-mile section of the Appalachian Trail (we are one of only two student
      | organizations in the nation that do). What looks like a lot of work, is
      | actually great fun. The satisfaction of giving back to the trail we all
      | love is a common bond within the club.
    </p>

    <p>
      | While we are not offically a non-profit organiation, all the officers are
      | volunteers and we do not require members to pay anything to go on trips.
      | All money collected from optional membership dues goes towards club shirts,
      | AT maintenance supplies, promotional materials, or other supplies needed to
      | run the club.
