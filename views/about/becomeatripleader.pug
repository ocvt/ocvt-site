      | An <strong>OCVT Trip Leader</strong> is much more than just a trip
      | logistics planner and executor. He or she is an integral part of the OCVT
      | community and strives to foster community both on and off the trail.
      | Awesome trips are great, but without an OCVT sense of identity that results
      | from being a part of something greater, we will simply be viewed as a guide
      | service. Anyone with a passion for the outdoors can be an OCVT trip leader.
      | If interested in becoming a trip leader, please <strong>contact the head
      | trip leader at <a href="mailto:OCVT-TRIPLEADER@vt.edu?Subject=%20trip%20leader"
      | target="_top">OCVT-TRIPLEADER@vt.edu</a></strong>. There is then an
      | application process for becoming a trip leader. Once becoming a trip
      | leader, one must lead at least <strong>2 trips</strong> each semester in
      | order to retain the position as well as attend monthly trip leader
      | meetings. Trip leaders are also strongly encouraged to attend weekly OCVT
      | meetings or socials, as this is where lasting OCVT community is built. Some
      | benefits include an awesome <strong>exclusive T-shirt and a priority OCVT
      | membership</strong>. There will also be trip leader-only trips. Again, if
      | you want to become a trip leader, don't hesitate to let us know!
